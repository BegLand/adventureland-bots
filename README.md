## Install & Build
This project requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install, and run the optional server.

1. Install Node.js
2. run `npm install`
3. run `npm run build`

## Run
The code in /source/saves is what you save to the character.

The code after step 3 of the install is what you save to the slots `mage`, `merchant`, `ranger`, and `warrior` using Adventure Land's save code functionality.

Instead of saving the code, you can optionally run `node build/server.js` to serve the code locally from your machine.
